  Automate and simplify the creation of labels for your repository.

  Usage: labelify [options]

  Options:
    --config
      Path to a specific configuration file (JSON, YAML, or CommonJS), or the
      name of a module in node_modules that points to one. If no --config
      argument is provided, \\"labelify\\" will search for configuration files in
      the following places, in this order:
        - a labelify property in package.json
        - a .labelify file (with or without filename extension:
          .json, .yaml, .yml, and .js are available)
        - a labelify.config.js file exporting a JS object
      The search will begin in the working directory and move up the directory
      tree until a configuration file is found.
    
    --config-basedir
      An absolute path to the directory that relative paths defining \\"extends\\"
      are *relative to*. Only necessary if these values are relative paths.
    
    --overlap, -o
      Removes all labels which are not in configuration from the repository.

    --platform, -p
      Type of platform where your store repository.
      Use platform option only when you have self hosted solution.
    
    --endpoint, -e
      Endpoint for your API.
      Use endpoint option only when you have nonstandard API URL fro your platform.

    --version, -v
